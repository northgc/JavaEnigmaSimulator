Java Enigma Machine Simulator
===================

A command line simulator for the German Enigma Machine written in Java. My implementation encrypts and decrypts whole strings at a time and allows the user to set custom rotors and settings.

You can read more about the real machine here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine

TODO: 
  More customized rotors
  GUI (some day)
